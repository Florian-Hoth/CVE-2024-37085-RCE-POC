CVE-2024-37085 Remote Code Execution Proof of Concept

README.md - The readme will repeat all the following information about the vulnerability so you don't forget it

automate.py - Automates the check_targets.py and CVE-2024-37085.py so you can check targets for vulnerabilities then exploit those vulnerabilities without having to do it all by hand individually

check_targets.py - As the name says, it checks targets. You pull a list of targets from Shodan or Zoom eye, throw the IPs into a text file, and then scan them to check if they're vulnerable or not. Alterantively you could run massscans and just check for the ports for an internet exposed vulnerabilities.

CVE-2024-37085.py - The holy grail. The PoC is in fully working condition, you can see more of how it works back on our github page or in the README.md file

Have fun!
